Description:

this was a team project for the programming course in my 2 semesters at the university and I did the GUI and OOP and handling errors part.
where my teammates were creating the dummy list of cars in parking in michel.txt and the others handled explaining and presenting the code,
This car parking system management application allows users to effectively manage information about cars within a parking system.
Users can perform actions such as adding, deleting, or modifying cars. The user can predefine a text file in this case michel.txt
where the app can cross-compare the car that is being added to the cars in that predefined file if it exists then the car will be 
automatically displayed in green which indicates that it has access to the parking. One of the application's unique features is the "Sign In" feature, 
which allows cars to be marked as authorized entrance into the parking system even if they were not originally on the predetermined list kept in michel.exe.
regardless of whether they are initially included in the predefined list stored in michel.exe. If the "Sign In" checkbox is checked during modification,
the car is marked as "registered" and displayed in green. If the checkbox is unchecked, the car is displayed in red.
